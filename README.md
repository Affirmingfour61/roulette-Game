Roulette is a game of chance, so your odds of winning on each spin are the same, regardless of whether you've won before. However, you can control how much you bet and how long you play.

Here are some basic rules of roulette:

**Objective:** Predict where the ball will land on the spinning wheel.

**Bets:** Place chips on the inside or outside sections of the table, on specific numbers, or on groups of numbers.

**Payouts:** Depending on how specific your prediction was, you can win up to 35 times your bet.

**Winning number:** After the ball stops spinning, the dealer will announce the winning number and the color of the pocket it landed in.

**Winning bets:** Markers are usually used to mark winning bets, and then the dealer pays out the winners.

**Losing bets:** The dealer sweeps losing bets off the table.

**Next spin:** Once payouts are complete, players can place bets for the next spin.
